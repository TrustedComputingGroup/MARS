    devid = device identifier derived from MARS (not X509)
    bsize = PCR bank size = # of PCRs
    nonce = number used once as a freshness challenge
   pcrsel = PCR selection, bitmask of PCRs to quote
       hw = crypto "hardware" used by MARS
 endorser = for symmetric attestation, location of endorser / signature verifier
 EventLog = subset of Event Log matching pcrsel
signature = MARS_Quote
   AKcert = X509 certificate for AK, if asymmetric supported
reply msg = textual response
